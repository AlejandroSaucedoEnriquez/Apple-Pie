         <p>This was Juan Carlos apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
         be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
         favorites as well! <br> <img class="ingcocina" src="./src/images/recipe-info.png" alt="ingredientes para cocinar"> <hr></p>

         slightly.Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so
         that it does not run off. <br>3) Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
         degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p><br><br>
